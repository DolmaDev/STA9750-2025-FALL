title: "Dolma Sherpa â€” STA 9750 Submissions"
---

## Welcome

Hello! My name is Dolma Sherpa, and I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Business Analytics at Baruch College. Alongside my graduate studies, I work as an Operations Coordinator at a consulting boutique in New York City.

I am excited to learn more about **data analytics** and **visualization tools** to drive insights, create meaningful impact, and, honestly, *make my work life more efficient and easier*.

Outside of academics and work, I enjoy exploring NYCâ€™s diverse food scene, attending many *free* events around the city, and spending time with my 5-year-old niece any chance I get.
